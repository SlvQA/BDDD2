Attention team members!!!
- you WON'T need to create your feature file under resources, it is already created, please make sure to work on your
own feature file:
user story 7 -- employment-income.feature
user story 8 -- credit-report.feature
user story 9 -- e-consent.feature
user story 10 -- reviewing-application.feature
user story 11 -- tracking-applications.feature


- once you are in your feature file, start creating scenarios using Given When Then structure (case sensitive), then
RUN the features, COPY the result, PASTE into your own step definition class that YOU are going to create under
stepDefinitions package. after pasting, keep the annotations and methods, delete the rest. Make sure to import the
annotations.

- ALWAYS run your test cases through RUNNERS class

- similar to testNG framework, we will use PAGES package for our locators and webElements and reusable methods
